						<li>Peak point in 2000 relates to the dotcom bubble. Largest VC deals were Western Integrated (Fiber to home network) and Zhone Technologies (telecommunications equipment). Fundings in the amount of 890MM and 500MM respectively.</li><br>
						<li>Increase in VC investiments starting on 2010. Many investors believe that technology is reshaping major industries enabling startups to achieve massive scale in a relatively short time. Largest VC deals were Facebook (1.5B), Uber (1.2B), Beats Electronics (500MM).

						<li>The amount VCs will put into young companies this year is on track to exceed the $49 billion, still this amount is very little compared to the $144 billion (in 2015 dollars) that VCs put into companies in 2000.</li><br>
						<li>In 2000, venture capitalists made 8,042 deals. In 2015, they completed only 4,361.</li><br>
						<li>Today, venture capital money is flowing into much later deals than it did in 2000. At the turn of the millennium, 17% of the investment dollars went into later-stage deals, versus 25% in 2014. </li><br>
						<li>In 2000, 73% of venture funding went into follow-on deals rather than first-time funding. Last year, the follow-on funding fraction was 85%.</li>
